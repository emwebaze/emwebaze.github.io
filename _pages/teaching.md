I have over 10 years experience in academia; teaching computer science and machine learning at Makerere University in Uganda. My teaching philosophy was premised above all on inspiring the students to learn how to learn, to continuously pursue knowledge within and outside their fields and how to apply that knowledge to better whichever context they found themselves in. Examples were picked from local problems  and datasets.
